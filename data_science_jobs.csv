8,cyber security,Cyber Security Analyst,Fractional CISO,"
Hiring for 2022 with flexible start date. Ideal for Graduating Candidates!
As a Cybersecurity Analyst (CA), you will play a pivotal role securing our clients’ infrastructure, data and software. Beyond helping our clients, you will also make a huge impact and help society as a whole by contributing to our fast moving, passionate efforts to smartly improve and promote cybersecurity best practices.
Fractional CISO is not a typical cybersecurity consulting firm. Instead of technical support, we focus on delivering the best possible cybersecurity advice to our client’s leadership teams. Our typical clients are medium sized tech firms with significant cybersecurity needs, but they’re not quite large enough yet to hire a full-time “C-level” senior security leader, like a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO). We fill that gap with our “fractional” CISO consulting services and help guide our clients on their cybersecurity improvement programs.
In this position, you will work as a team with a vCISO client manager to provide cybersecurity leadership and program management directly to our clients. You will work with a wide range of companies across many industries to develop and deliver the components of a good cybersecurity management program, including:

Leading Internal Cybersecurity Audits to ensure our clients’ operational environments stay compliant and secure.
Planning and running tabletop training exercises to help our clients’ employees practice how they will respond to a cybersecurity incident.
Performing quantitative Risk Assessments for clients so they can understand where to make smart investments in their cybersecurity.
Responding to security questionnaires from our clients’ customers so they can grow their businesses.
Writing cybersecurity policy documents to build up our clients’ cybersecurity programs.
Assisting with evidence collection to help our clients prepare for external compliance audits.
Providing advice and guidance to clients on a wide range of cybersecurity topics.

The right candidate for this position will possess all of these traits:

A passion about solving clients’ security challenges
High personal and professional ethical standards
Well-developed technical writing skills
Quantitative or analytical work/school experience
A degree with a cybersecurity focus, or +2 years of work experience in cybersecurity or closely related field.

In addition, highly qualified candidates will likely possess technical experience in one of these areas:

Security Operations (SOC)
Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC) practices
System Administration (Windows, Linux)
Cloud Administration (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Network or firewall administration

And have one or more of these skills:

Knowledge of security operations tools, systems, and practices (SIEM, WAF, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, system hardening, MFA, SSO, etc.)
Able to explain at a high level how the Internet and websites function
Familiar with core networking concepts, protocols, and common services
Understanding of encryption concepts and SSL/TLS certificates
General scripting or coding experience
Cybersecurity certifications (SSCP, CompTIA Security+, etc.)
Experience with any security frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS, COBIT, etc.)
Experience with any compliance standards (SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

While we value candidates with operational experience, this role is not the same as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst! This job does not focus on routine security tasks like monitoring logs, responding to security alerts, patching systems, or running vulnerability scans. If you have experience as a SOC analyst but are looking for a new challenge that will advance your career towards thoughtful cybersecurity leadership, this may be a great position for you!
We are committed to providing guidance and support to the right Cybersecurity Analyst candidate so they can accelerate their cybersecurity career. What we ask in return is that the candidate bring a passion for cybersecurity, a strong work ethic, and demonstrated excellence in their prior positions or coursework. We value diversity and believe that qualified candidates are just as likely to come from a non-traditional work or educational backgrounds.
Note: We genuinely appreciate it when candidates take the time to write a brief cover letter that explains their interest in the position and what attracted them to a career in cybersecurity!
We are open to sponsoring a H1-B visa for the right candidate.
About Fractional CISO:
Fractional CISO provides Virtual CISOs to organizations, helping its customers reduce their cybersecurity risk. Fractional CISO’s Virtual CISOs establish and maintain clients’ cybersecurity programs, policies and procedures, manage technical staff, perform gap and risk assessments, and manage compliance.
Please learn more about our company culture here: https://fractionalciso.com/fractional-ciso-fundamentals/
Fractional CISO helps organizations make better cybersecurity decisions.
Our employees follow the standard Code of Ethics as defined by the (ISC)2.

10,cyber security,Director of Information Security,Wistia,"Wistia is looking for a Director of Infosec to ensure that we're building a product and organization that's secure by design, as we make business more human with a suite of video-focused innovations.



Responsible disclosure: we think about security a bit differently at Wistia. We're not looking for someone to implement a bunch of best practices and police them, nor a risk eliminator, nor a formal authority who checks a box. We're looking for someone who will think critically about our business goals to determine the most risk-appropriate ways to achieve them; a pragmatist who takes security seriously while acknowledging that policies and practices have real tradeoffs; a thoughtful expert who knows that certifications and industry standards are no substitute for deep contextual understanding and sound judgment.

As Director of Infosec, you will be responsible for ensuring we:

Educate our employees - at all levels - with helpful and relevant security and data privacy trainings.
Vet vendors, subprocessors and any other third parties who may handle sensitive data on our behalf.
Derive maximal benefit from white hat security researchers via bug bounties and other programs.
Have clear, practical processes for handling breaches, data loss, and natural disasters.
Proactively monitor for and respond to urgent issues and CVEs that would otherwise put us at risk.
Design, codify, and implement a company security policy that protects us while enabling us to achieve our goals.
Understand our customers' security concerns, and address them through action or explanation.

You will work with our most senior leaders to help drive strategic discussions like:

Whether and when we should become SOC2 compliant.
How to manage devices in a way that provides both privacy for employees and security for the company.
What forms of background checks are most appropriate, relevant, and helpful, given Wistia's needs and risks.

You'll fit in great for this role if you:

Take pride in enabling others to meet their goals in ways that are secure by design.
Are a creative problem solver and first principles thinker.
Are adept at identifying flawed assumptions, and proactive but courteous in pointing them out.
View security as a company-wide concern, not just an IT or engineering problem - and are excited to help everyone at Wistia understand this.
Would feel incredibly proud to look back on a year's work, and have leveled up all employees' understanding of security concerns that are relevant to their respective areas.
Understand the importance of communicating the ""why"" behind security work (it's much easier to change behavior by showing folks how a policy is helpful, than it is to merely insist that it is helpful).
Are familiar with consumer privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

You won't be a fit for this role if you:

View security as being largely about policing - pushing back, clamping down, needing to approve things, etc.
Rely on formal authority to get groups to arrive at appropriate decisions.
Can't cite examples of recommendations you've made that go against common industry practices.

Your success will be assessed according to:

Fulfillment of the items you're responsible for, as mentioned above.
Helping drive the strategic discussions mentioned above, by bringing clarity of costs, benefits, and tradeoffs therein.
Identifying our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as they pertain to security and privacy, and building a sensible roadmap to make progress on them.
Whether stakeholders can do their jobs with improved awareness and confidence in the security aspects of their decisions.

Your success looks like:

30 Days

Complete Wistia onboarding program.
Understand Wistia's business, where we are on security and privacy today, and why we've made the choices we've made to date.
Come up with a plan for how best to incorporate security training in our employee onboarding.

90 Days

Implement security onboarding plan mentioned above.
Come up with and implement a plan for recurrent security training at Wistia.
Work with engineering to implement an effective bug bounty program (or find another way to help us take advantage of white hat researchers who are eager to help us).
Identify, roughly, what it would take for Wistia to become SOC2 compliant.
Implement clear, practical processes for handling breaches, data loss, natural disasters, and other circumstances we work hard to avoid but need to be prepared for.
Answer the business-level security questions we get from key customers.

6 months

Answer the product-level security questions we get from key customers.
Fully flesh out a SOC2 roadmap in granular detail. Identify where we stand, what a plan looks like to get there, and what sequencing should look like if we opt to go this route.
Come up with plan and process for monitoring and responding to urgent CVEs that affect employee-used tools.
Help us figure out how to manage devices in a way that provides both privacy for employees and security for the company.

1 Year

Make appropriate progress on our SOC2 plan, if we go that route.
Administer annual penetration test.
Come up with plan and process for monitoring and responding to urgent CVEs that affect our product.
Come up with and implement a plan for vetting new vendors, subprocessors, and other third parties who handle sensitive data.

14,cyber security,Director of Information Security,Wistia,"Wistia is looking for a Director of Infosec to ensure that we're building a product and organization that's secure by design, as we make business more human with a suite of video-focused innovations.



Responsible disclosure: we think about security a bit differently at Wistia. We're not looking for someone to implement a bunch of best practices and police them, nor a risk eliminator, nor a formal authority who checks a box. We're looking for someone who will think critically about our business goals to determine the most risk-appropriate ways to achieve them; a pragmatist who takes security seriously while acknowledging that policies and practices have real tradeoffs; a thoughtful expert who knows that certifications and industry standards are no substitute for deep contextual understanding and sound judgment.

As Director of Infosec, you will be responsible for ensuring we:

Educate our employees - at all levels - with helpful and relevant security and data privacy trainings.
Vet vendors, subprocessors and any other third parties who may handle sensitive data on our behalf.
Derive maximal benefit from white hat security researchers via bug bounties and other programs.
Have clear, practical processes for handling breaches, data loss, and natural disasters.
Proactively monitor for and respond to urgent issues and CVEs that would otherwise put us at risk.
Design, codify, and implement a company security policy that protects us while enabling us to achieve our goals.
Understand our customers' security concerns, and address them through action or explanation.

You will work with our most senior leaders to help drive strategic discussions like:

Whether and when we should become SOC2 compliant.
How to manage devices in a way that provides both privacy for employees and security for the company.
What forms of background checks are most appropriate, relevant, and helpful, given Wistia's needs and risks.

You'll fit in great for this role if you:

Take pride in enabling others to meet their goals in ways that are secure by design.
Are a creative problem solver and first principles thinker.
Are adept at identifying flawed assumptions, and proactive but courteous in pointing them out.
View security as a company-wide concern, not just an IT or engineering problem - and are excited to help everyone at Wistia understand this.
Would feel incredibly proud to look back on a year's work, and have leveled up all employees' understanding of security concerns that are relevant to their respective areas.
Understand the importance of communicating the ""why"" behind security work (it's much easier to change behavior by showing folks how a policy is helpful, than it is to merely insist that it is helpful).
Are familiar with consumer privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

You won't be a fit for this role if you:

View security as being largely about policing - pushing back, clamping down, needing to approve things, etc.
Rely on formal authority to get groups to arrive at appropriate decisions.
Can't cite examples of recommendations you've made that go against common industry practices.

Your success will be assessed according to:

Fulfillment of the items you're responsible for, as mentioned above.
Helping drive the strategic discussions mentioned above, by bringing clarity of costs, benefits, and tradeoffs therein.
Identifying our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as they pertain to security and privacy, and building a sensible roadmap to make progress on them.
Whether stakeholders can do their jobs with improved awareness and confidence in the security aspects of their decisions.

Your success looks like:

30 Days

Complete Wistia onboarding program.
Understand Wistia's business, where we are on security and privacy today, and why we've made the choices we've made to date.
Come up with a plan for how best to incorporate security training in our employee onboarding.

90 Days

Implement security onboarding plan mentioned above.
Come up with and implement a plan for recurrent security training at Wistia.
Work with engineering to implement an effective bug bounty program (or find another way to help us take advantage of white hat researchers who are eager to help us).
Identify, roughly, what it would take for Wistia to become SOC2 compliant.
Implement clear, practical processes for handling breaches, data loss, natural disasters, and other circumstances we work hard to avoid but need to be prepared for.
Answer the business-level security questions we get from key customers.

6 months

Answer the product-level security questions we get from key customers.
Fully flesh out a SOC2 roadmap in granular detail. Identify where we stand, what a plan looks like to get there, and what sequencing should look like if we opt to go this route.
Come up with plan and process for monitoring and responding to urgent CVEs that affect employee-used tools.
Help us figure out how to manage devices in a way that provides both privacy for employees and security for the company.

1 Year

Make appropriate progress on our SOC2 plan, if we go that route.
Administer annual penetration test.
Come up with plan and process for monitoring and responding to urgent CVEs that affect our product.
Come up with and implement a plan for vetting new vendors, subprocessors, and other third parties who handle sensitive data.

About Wistia
We try to ensure Wistia is an inclusive and diverse place where everyone feels happy, fulfilled, respected, comfortable, and welcome. We're proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We care a lot, so our benefits are actually benefits, not just the fun stuff like swag and snacks in the office (though we also have lots of those too!).
