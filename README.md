# job-posting-analysis

This project confronts machine-based hiring barriers with a machine-based solution, informing applicants of what available positions best match their skillset to give them the best shot of being hired for the jobs they want. We collected data from Indeed on current job listings in Boston across several tech-related industries. We extracted relevant skills from all job descriptions for a given industry and analyzed the similarities and differences of skills required for specific jobs. Additionally, by inputting resumes, we are able to recommend the most suitable jobs for a candidate by matching the skills on their resume to the skills the jobs in our data. To refine the job recommendations, we suggest more advanced skill extraction techniques from the job data collected to ensure proper matching.
