14,data analyst,Data Analyst,Wave,"Our mission

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In November 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. In 2019, we expanded to Cote d'Ivoire. Now, we have millions of users and are growing fast. Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent. And that's where you come in....
How you'll help us achieve it

We're looking for a data analyst who's both a SQL expert and a researcher; a self-starter that excels at exploring problems and producing analytical content. You'll be embedded with product teams: deriving insights from customer data, visualizing data and then working with product managers, engineers and product ops to improve user and business outcomes. You'll own every step of the research process—from gathering requirements, to shipping your solution for users or stakeholders, to sharing your findings with others.

In this role, you'll:

Work within a product team but interface with a variety of teams in dozens of countries. You may rotate to other product teams over time.
Research into problems or processes that require data-driven improvements.
Navigate large sets of data and derive meaning to deliver insights to stakeholders.
Support or manage projects implementing data-focused tools.
Key Details
You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +4).
Every four months, our remote team meets in Africa for a one-week retreat. (Wave covers all costs.)
