2,web developer,Senior Front-End Engineer,Tidelift,"

What we're building
 At Tidelift, we are making open source work better for everyone by helping organizations effectively manage the open source behind modern applications while ensuring open source maintainers get paid for the incredible value they create. We are creating a mutually beneficial commercial model for open source where both creators and enterprise users get what they need, and the world gets even more healthy and secure software that improves our lives.
 We're well-funded and growing fast. You will play a large role in tackling challenging problems and helping expand the company, while learning alongside our experienced team.
 Find out more about us on tidelift.com, listen to this recent podcast interview with our CEO Donald Fischer, or read about us in Wired or Business Insider.
 The role
 We’re looking for senior frontend engineers who are comfortable in the browser, crafting JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. You should have experience working with a team to build a custom web application. At this level, in addition to a proficiency in frontend engineering, you probably have an area where you consider yourself strong. This could be a second competency as well which could be visual design, interaction design, backend development, or perhaps some skills you have which we haven’t considered. You’ll be working closely both with the rest of the engineering team as well as with designers to help us implement a product that looks great and is a joy to use.
 Tidelift is working with companies to make it simple to trust, ship, and grow open source. Our customers use our tools and services to centralize and reduce the effort required to take care of the open source they rely on. You can read the docs to learn more, and ask us tough questions.
 Starting pay:

$165,000 per year base salary
Generous stock option grant

Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Tidelift is a place where everyone can grow. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day.
 The team
 We want a team where everyone cares about users, design, building a business, and one another. We’re also aiming for work-life harmony: we believe in doing good work, with urgency and pragmatism, but at a sustainable pace. We value big impact as opposed to long hours.
 Our values
 We’re trying to build a healthy, values-driven culture. We want to be:

Optimistic: We see an amazing future ahead, and want to inspire others to share in it. This is both internal—building each other up and looking for the best in people—and external—we know open source is awesome, and we want to make it even better. 
Practical: We know words and ideas alone won’t change lives. We help people most by creating a pragmatic, viable, and sustainable business that works for everyone. So we care about usability, design, and honest assessment of costs and benefits. 
Additive: We want an environment that encourages and inspires growth, both for individuals and for the open source community as a whole. That means embracing a growth mindset, and valuing culture-add over culture-fit. 
Inclusive: We believe technology will be stronger when it better reflects the voices and ideas of society as a whole. So we want people from different backgrounds and experiences to not just be represented, but to be heard, valued, and flourish. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment.

To find out more about how we live these in practice, we’ve written more about living our values “inside and out”.
 Working at Tidelift
 We are (and have been) remote-first from day 1. In this role you would have the option to work remotely from anywhere in the US. We get together in person 2-4 times a year, so some ability to travel is required (though we aim not to require travel on weekends, and travel remains optional during COVID). We’ve written more about how we do remote work here, here, and here.
 We believe in the urgency of our mission and the importance of doing good work, but also know this is a marathon and not a sprint. Hours are flexible when necessary to meet personal needs (like child, medical, or elder care).
 Tidelift is committed to the safety of its employees, and so requires that all employees be vaccinated for COVID before participating in any in-person company activities.
 Compensation, benefits and career
 Tidelift’s approach to compensation is designed to ensure that we are staying true to our core values of being optimistic, additive, inclusive, and practical. We do this by:   

Rewarding tenure: We are optimists, believing that each of us is bringing our best to work each day. In this spirit, we provide predetermined raises of at least 3% each year based on the belief that you are working hard and learning more about Tidelift and your role, making yourself more valuable to the company every day. Each year we will refresh our model for rewarding tenure with new market data, and share an updated compensation trajectory with you. 
Holding firmly to a no-negotiation policy: In the spirit of our values to be inclusive and additive, we believe employees hired to perform the same role should receive the same compensation, regardless of location, negotiation prowess, prior salary, or years of experience prior to joining Tidelift. All Tidelift offers have compensation packages that are determined prior to the start of recruitment. This, along with a structured interview process, is intended to mitigate the effects of both shifting criteria bias and the ask gap on wages within Tidelift, and is an essential element of our equity, diversity, and inclusion strategy. 
Sharing our process transparently. You and your colleagues are doing important work, and we want to compensate you fairly in return. We transparently document how we approach compensation at Tidelift, including our methodology for calculating initial offers, raises, and promotions, so that you know exactly what you can expect from us over your career here.

In addition to cash and equity compensation, Tidelift offers medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance as well as the ability to contribute pre-tax dollars to flexible spending and retirement (401k) accounts. As a remote-first company, we offer a variety of remote work stipends to cover expenses such as co-working spaces, internet, and phone connections. Finally, all employees have access to generous vacation and gender-neutral parental leave policies as well as the ability to reimburse up to $5k annually for their own professional development.
 How to apply

In R&D At GSK, we want to find new medicines and vaccines in ways that are faster, more effective and more predictable.
We start with what matters most, the science. Our approach to R&D focuses on science related to the immune system, the use of human genetics, and advanced technologies. Our pipeline currently comprises of more than 60 vaccines and medicines across four core therapeutic areas including oncology, infectious diseases, immunology / respiratory and HIV. We have pivotal study starts in 2021 for our RSV vaccine in older adults, COVID-19 assets, long-acting anti-IL-5 antagonist, daprodustat, and dostarlimab. In oncology, momentum is building with 15 potential medicines in trials, including nine immuno-oncology and three cell therapies.
We give our scientists the freedom to own the process. Our scientists often use genetic data to help us understand the root cause of disease. We steer the research where the data shows we can do most good. If a project doesn’t pan out, we take what we’ve learned and apply it elsewhere.
Technology can help us find patterns in genetic data better and faster. We’re using machine learning to unlock the potential of complex genetic data with new levels of speed, precision, and scale. And we’re one of the first biopharmaceutical companies to have created an in-house AI lab dedicated to drug development.
Even with the knowledge, tools, and resources within GSK, there’s always a benefit to new perspectives. That's why we're increasingly partnering with and hiring outstanding people from cutting edge fields like tech, data-science and academia. In 2018, GSK formed an exclusive, highly innovative collaboration with 23andMe, the world's leading consumer genetics and research company. Other partners include: the Altius Institute; the UK Biobank, which is generating anonymized genetic sequence data from 500,000 volunteers; and the Open Targets Consortium, the mindset and approach of smaller, more agile startups.

Employer Description
Guillermo J. Tearney, M.D., Ph.D.
Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine
Massachusetts General Hospital


Until recently, visualizing the architectural and cellular morphology of human tissue has required histopathological examination. Samples would be excised from the patient, processed, sectioned, stained and viewed under a microscope. In addition to being invasive, time consuming and costly, the static nature of conventional pathology prohibits the study of biological dynamics and function. The Tearney Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital has led the way in transforming the current diagnostic paradigm through the invention and translation of new noninvasive, high-resolution optical imaging modalities that enable disease diagnosis from living patients without excising tissues from the body.
Led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD, the lab’s 80+ person multidisciplinary team invents, validates and translates novel devices that use light to conduct microscopy in living patients. Light is uniquely well suited for noninvasively interrogating the microscopic structure, molecular composition and biomechanical properties of biological tissues.

Data Analyst I - (3192962)
  


 The MGH Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases (CIID) is looking for exceptional computational biologist candidates to join the Single Cell Genomics Research Program directed by Dr. Alexandra-Chloé Villani. This multidisciplinary research program focuses on developing and implementing systems immunology and genomics strategies to further our understanding of the human immune system. The Villani laboratory is also affiliated to the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard, offering additional opportunities to collaborate and bridge with this vibrant community.
This position offers the opportunity to employ the cutting-edge of computational biology, machine learning and statistical research to solve important problems in health and disease related to the human immune system, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Single cell genomics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology – from redefining our understanding of the types of cells, a fundamental unit in biology, to translating this knowledge to better understand disease phenotypes and the implications of this to therapeutics. We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with a computational background to join our efforts. This position represents an exciting opportunity to work as a member of an interdisciplinary team of biologists, laboratory scientists, computational biologists, and physicians working together on transformative translational efforts that are bridging between the clinical and research interfaces. Our research program is developing and implementing unbiased experimental and computational strategies that can directly survey the human immune system in order to define at high resolution the key processes and players underlying healthy human immune responses as a foundation for understanding how immunity is dysregulated in diseases. This includes establishing a more comprehensive roadmap of the human immune system through identifying novel immune cell subpopulations across tissues using single-cell ‘omics’ strategies along with mapping the cellular ecosystem and associated molecular circuitry driving immune diseases. Collectively, our research program is empowering the study of the human immune system as a function of “healthy” baseline, inflammatory state, disease progression, and response to treatment with emphasis on precision medicine, ultimately paving the way for developing a comprehensive human immune lexicon that is key to promoting effective bench-to-beside translation of findings. 
As part of this position, you will conceive and apply algorithms as well as analytical approaches to analyze single-cell RNA/DNA/protein/ATAC-sequencing sequencing data generated from a wide-range of human tissue and immune-related disease conditions. The candidates will also take the lead on performing a wide range single-cell multi-omics analyses and collaborate directly with scientists performing experimental research studies at the bench and physicians seeing the patients. You must be capable of working in an interactive team environment while conducting self-directed research within broader goals set by group.
NO PRIOR BIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND REQUIRED, just strong computational & quantitative skills and enthusiasm to learn on the job. 
CHARACTERISTIC DUTIES

Design and implement methods for single cell genomics analysis of biological data
Lead and contribute to single-cell genomics analysis of biological data
Evaluate and recommend new emerging single-cell genomics analytical approaches 
Integrate single-cell data with other available genetic, sequencing, and epigenetic datasets to help prioritize potential cell types and therapeutic targets 
Collaborate with experimentalists and associate computational biologists to develop and apply functional genomics techniques
Collaborate with the MGH and Broad Institute single-cell analysis community 
Create scientifically rigorous visualizations, communications, and presentations of results
Contribute to generation of protocols, publications, and intellectual property

Solid foundation in the fundamentals of statistics, the use of algorithms and data analysis relevant to computational biology, and the ability to approach problems with scientific rigor.
Must have demonstrated proficiency with several of the following programing languages: Python, R, Java, C/C++, or Matlab, with a preference towards Python, and R.
Proficiency working in a Linux environment, knowledge of terminal shell usage (e.g. bash).
Familiarity with next-generation sequence data analysis tools; ideally will have some prior experience with statistical methods, pipelines and tools relevant to single-cell RNAseq analysis 
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, and the ability to explain technical/mathematical reasoning to people from non-quantitative backgrounds
Independent, highly motivated, and highly collaborative with the ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams of biologists, laboratory scientists, computational biologists, and physicians.
Experience in research lab or the industry working with analysis of real genomic datasets (preferred but not required)
