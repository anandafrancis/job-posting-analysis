What if the most important life decisions could be made more wisely?

We're the company that's showing millions of families how good guidance can materially change life outcomes.

To make good guidance possible, we focus on consumer technology, encompassing everything from innovative applications of machine learning to elegant data-driven experiences to non-exploitative social media and a fast-growing marketplace—all while staying true to a distinctly human purpose: turning crucial milestones into life-changing opportunities.

Our best known brand, CollegeVine, is revolutionizing the high school to college transition period. In contrast to just a few years ago, families can now explore schools efficiently, make the admissions process less lonely and stressful by connecting with peers, learn from the best admissions experts for free via livestreams, and construct school lists with known acceptance risk profiles thanks to our ML models. Using the CollegeVine platform, millions of students from all walks of life are making better decisions every year and finding new, valuable opportunities—all for free.

And this is just the start. Our vision is ambitious: to be the lifelong guidance platform for the next generation. We're growing rapidly and can't wait to meet mission-oriented teammates like yourself!


About the role

The CollegeVine team is growing and we're looking for engineering managers to support our growth. You'll be responsible for leading a team of 4-8 engineers across one or two cross-functional squads. Our squads are comprised of engineers, product managers, and designers, and you'll need to work closely with all of them to deliver value. CollegeVine's culture rewards a focus on solving the right problems, a bias for action, owning your work, and fast feedback.

Responsibilities
Drive value creation: your primary goal is ensuring your team consistently creates outsized business value through their work.
Mentor your team: you will grow and support a high-performance application engineering team comprised of varied experience levels.
Collaborate across the company: you will wok with leaders inside and outside of the Engineering org to ensure your team is solving the right problems.
Keep the big picture in sight: you will work with your team and other leaders to make time for important but not urgent work via well-thought planning.
Who we're looking for

Your peers consider you a senior software engineer
You've led an engineering team for at least a year, ideally 3+
A servant leader who provides day-to-day support for the team without needing to feed their own ego
Comfortable with managing a fully remote team
An extraordinarily fast learner with natural curiosity and the intellectual horsepower required to deeply understand new topics and pick up new skills on the fly
A relentlessly resourceful problem-solver: you excel at identifying unintuitive solutions to tough problems
An optimist with a positive energy that other people draw upon
A champion for the 10 million+ families that we reach every year
Why you'll love being a leader on the Engineering team

Clearly see the impact of your work: you're literally changing the course of people's lives when they make a decision using our platform.
Autonomy in your work: nobody knows your team's details better than you, and you'll have plenty of blank space to lead as you see fit.
Short cycle times: without feedback you can't learn, so we try to make the cycle time between having an idea and getting it in users' hands as short as possible. We aim to ship what we start within two days.
Data-driven decision making: we believe the first step of managing something is understanding it, so we use sophisticated tools to understand our codebase and the Engineering org's overall performance.
Exciting technology: whether you get excited about creating novel user experiences, working with advanced static-type systems, or operationalizing machine learning models, we have a problem for you that you'll be excited to solve.


Why you'll love working at CollegeVine
Enjoy actually meaningful work: Spare yourself the dread of having to do mental gymnastics about your company's mission by working on something that's high impact and clearly beneficial for society.
Iterate quickly and see the impact of your decisions and hard work: You'll find that the teammates who you serve are not only appreciative, and also celebrate your ideas and innovations.
Be part of a strong consumer brand: We've been closing the guidance gap in the United States since 2013 and have one of the most valuable brands in the higher education attainment space. Mention you work at CollegeVine to any college-bound family and see their faces light up.
Contribute to a mindful remote culture with real flexibility: We claim to do remote right and can't wait to talk to you about it. If you find a team you love, working on a mission you find meaningful, then why let caring for a loved one, moving cross-country, venturing abroad, or even living on a boat stop you?


CollegeVine was founded in 2013 in Cambridge, MA and reaches over 10 million families annually who are in the high school-to-college or college-to-career phases. Our roots are in delivering near-peer mentorship at scale, which has since evolved to delivering lifelong guidance with a focus on data and technology. We have raised over $42m in venture funding from dedicated investors such as Morningside Technology Ventures (Xiaomi, TikTok), the founding partner of 5Y Capital, Fidelity, University Ventures, and more. In 2020, after years of being a remote-friendly company, CollegeVine became a fully remote company centered on Eastern Time with a diverse cast of team members based predominantly in the United States, but also around the world."

Proton cuts through this complexity with AI. We provide a solution that modernizes distributors' sales efforts. Distributors using our software get a measurable 10X ROI on their investment in Proton.

Our company is in hyper-growth mode. We've had significant year-over-year revenue growth, and we just raised a $20M Series A backed by Felicis Ventures (investors in Twitch, Shopify, Opendoor, and many others) and Battery Ventures. Needless to say, it's an exciting time to join the Proton.ai team.

Team development: Build training processes for new engineers and services staff. Support team members on career growth.
Internal communication: Work with internal teams and departments to establish bidirectional communication and alignment with your team.
You'll be a great fit for this role if you have:
A focus for the customer: You thrive in a client-facing context and focus on delivering value to the customer.
Technical skills: As a technical expert, you'll need to have the ability to understand and discuss various architectures and solutions and how those impact the customer experience and success.
Organization and resourcing skills: As a leader of a professional services team, you'll be overseeing the delivery of solutions for multiple enterprise clients in parallel, so being able to organize, schedule and forecast work will be critical for the success of your team.
Growth Mindset: You understand that this stage company is about creating scalable processes - but also about being flexible. You seek to evolve decisions and directions as needed, learning from experience and feedback.
Autonomous Motivation: You take ownership of your own work, and thrive when given creative freedom. You help push the status quo to improve our processes and customer experience.

We know the confidence gap can get in the way of great candidates putting their hats in the ring. So even if you don't think you perfectly check every box above, we'd still love for you to apply!

Benefits:
Competitive Salaries + Company Stock Options - we want to pay you well (and equitably!) and make you feel like an owner.
Flexible Schedule - we think high levels of autonomy, responsibility and working asynchronously foster an amazing workplace.
Unlimited PTO + 10 Company Paid Holidays - we even have tools implemented to detect burnout to make sure folks recharge regularly.

12 Weeks Fully Paid Parental Leave - that goes for primary and secondary caregivers; even if you're adopting or fostering!
Biannual Company Paid off-sites - time for us to be together, brainstorm, and make magic happen.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Geo-Solutions has offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (headquarters), St. Petersburg, Florida, Denver, Colorado, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Geo-Solutions has successfully completed over 1,500 projects throughout the United States and Canada, and in international markets like Brazil, Brunei, Belgium, China, Denmark, Japan, Ireland, Italy, and Australia.
Geo-Solutions is a leader in full-service environmental remediation and geotechnical construction, working across the US, Canada, and in select international markets in the areas of subsurface stabilization, remedial actions, groundwater control, and subgrade improvement. Geo-Solutions offers innovative, cost-effective, and practical solutions to environmental and civil engineering problems involving soil and groundwater. Geo-Solutions personnel have over 800 years of combined experience and have been at the forefront of numerous construction technologies including soil mixing, jet grouting, slurry walls, bio-polymer collection trenches, and other grouting services for a range of public and private sector clients.
From our roots in 1979, Geo-Solutions has evolved from being a specialty geotechnical contractor into one of the leading geoenvironmental construction contractors in the industry. That expansion of services was made possible by the transfer of our geotechnical capabilities into new applications. However, we have continued to innovate and successfully sustain our roots in the civil geotechnical industry. Many of our specialized environmental construction technologies, including shallow and deep soil mixing for in situ fixation or stabilization and permeable reactive groundwater treatment barriers using slurry wall techniques, were derived from our previous experience with civil geotechnical projects. By design, we have invested our time and financial resources in the development of equipment and processes that advance the science of our specialized technologies.
Our construction experience and capabilities are focused today in three service areas: environmental remediation, civil/geotechnical construction, and wetlands mitigation, enhancement and restoration. Geo-Solutions can perform in these service areas as a general contractor, a specialty trade contractor, or in a design/build capacity. We remain flexible to meet the needs of our clients.
